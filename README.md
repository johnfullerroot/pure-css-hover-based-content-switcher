A fully CSS-driven content switcher that uses hover states to toggle visibility — **no JavaScript required**.

## Overview

This project implements an animated tabbed content switcher using **only HTML and CSS**, with a novel hover-based approach. Unlike the widely used checkbox/radio hacks common online, this method:

- Allows content panels to switch **on hover**, no clicks required  
- Stacks all panels in the same position, hidden by default (`visibility: hidden; opacity: 0`)  
- Provides a sleeker, cleaner, and more fluid UI experience  

This approach demonstrates that state-like interface behavior can be achieved elegantly **without JavaScript** or form input tricks.

## Features

- Pure CSS, no JavaScript  
- Smooth hover-based animations  
- Easy to integrate into other projects  
- Lightweight and minimal  
- Works in all modern browsers  

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Why This is Unique

Most “pure CSS tabs” online rely on checkbox/radio input hacks. These have limitations:

- Require a click to switch tabs
- Keep a persistent state that can clutter the UI
- Depend on careful label/input pairing and DOM order

This project’s hover-only method is simpler, faster, and more natural for previewing or switching content quickly.
